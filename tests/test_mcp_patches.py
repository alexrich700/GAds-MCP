"""The cancellation-race workaround has to be reachable by embedders.

python-sdk#2416 takes the transport down when a host cancels a slow tool
call. The workaround lived behind the stdio entry point, so anything that
embedded the server in an ASGI app ran unprotected: importing
adloop.server is deliberately side-effect-free, and the patch went with
the side effects. install_runtime_patches() is the supported way for an
embedder to arm it.
