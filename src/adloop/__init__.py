    Importing ``adloop.server`` is deliberately free of process-global side
    effects so the server can be embedded in an ASGI app. That leaves the
    workarounds in ``_mcp_patches`` unarmed for any embedder, including a
    hosted deployment, which is exactly where they matter most: the
    cancellation race they guard against (python-sdk#2416) fires when a
    host cancels a slow tool call, and it takes the transport down with it.

    Embedders should call this once during application startup. It is
    idempotent, never raises, and each patch inside self-disarms once the
    upstream bug it tracks is fixed.
